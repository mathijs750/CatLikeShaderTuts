# Course work from Catlike Coding's _Shader Fundamentals_ tutorial series

### Goal
Get a better understanding of shaders by folowing a more indepth tutorial series. By learning about shaders on a more fundemental I aim to get better at optimising and debugging more complex shaders.

### Time tracking
To calculate the time spend on one tutorial find the difference beteen the `Create tutorial X folder` commit and the `Complete tutorial X` commit.
